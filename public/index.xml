      <description>I’m a 30 years old enthusiastic game programmer from Tunisia. Graduated in 2015 from ESPRIT as a software engineer with a mobile development background. I have been making games since 2012 and I’m currently an independant contractor at TRU LUV working on #SelfCare. I believe that to keep up with the fast-paced technology and innovations popping off every single day, you&amp;rsquo;ve got to love what you are doing.
 I’M A FLEXIBLE PROGRAMMER WITH EAGERNESS TO LEARN I don’t only code because it’s part of my day-to-day job but it’s deeper than that.</description>
