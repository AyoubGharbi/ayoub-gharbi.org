      <description>Imagine cup was one of the best experiences in my whole life as a student. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t expecting to get the first place in Tunisia since it was the first time I participate in this kind of competitions but our team was strong and we had variety of expertises that facilitated split of tasks and made us work fast and efficiently.
